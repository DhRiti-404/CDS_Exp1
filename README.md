âœ… 1. #include <iostream> in C++
ðŸ”¹ What is it?
#include <iostream> is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the contents of the iostream library before actual compilation starts.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose:
The iostream (input-output stream) library allows us to perform input and output operations using the standard stream objects:

cin â†’ for standard input (usually from the keyboard)
cout â†’ for standard output (usually to the screen)
cerr â†’ for error output
clog â†’ for logging

âœ… 2. Using namespace std;
ðŸ”¹ What is a namespace?
A namespace is a feature in C++ used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name conflicts. The standard C++ library functions (like cout, cin, string, etc.) are defined inside the std namespace.
