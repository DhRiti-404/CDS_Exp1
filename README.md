EXPERIMENT 1: Hello World and Basic Calculator Program (C++)
Aim:
To write and execute a basic "Hello World" program in C++.
To create a simple calculator in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations.
Apparatus
Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)
Theory
Hello World
The "Hello World" program is a basic starting point in learning any programming language. It helps in understanding the basic syntax of C++, including the main() function, output statements, and the general structure of a C++ program.

Calculator Program
The calculator program demonstrates how to take user input and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It introduces essential programming concepts in C++ like input/output handling, conditional statements, and arithmetic operators.

Functions
Hello World
Displays a message on the screen.
Demonstrates basic program structure in C++.
Verifies that the compiler and environment are working correctly.
Calculator
Takes two numerical inputs from the user.
Allows the user to select an arithmetic operation.
Performs the selected operation using conditional logic.
Outputs the result.
Handles basic errors like division by zero.
Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how to write a basic C++ program and understood the structure and syntax of the language. The Hello World program helped me get familiar with the environment, and the calculator program taught me how to take user input, use conditional statements, and perform arithmetic operations. This exercise built my confidence in using C++ for problem-solving.
